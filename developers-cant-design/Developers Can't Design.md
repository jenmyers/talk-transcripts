**Jen Myers**

Thank you.

OK, so I'm going to start off just at the very beginning. I'm Jen, and I have a confession. I am a designer. You let one into your midst and now I have the stage so you're stuck. So buckle in and going on on this for a while so. So like my slide says I say designer. I feel like every time I tell people this, I say I am a design but I'm a designer, it has a little asterisk by it, and that asterisk has two or three paragraphs that describe what I mean when I say designer. And if I don't go off and explain that people ask me because that means lots of different things, so I will say when I say that I am a designer, as Paul mentioned, I work for a software company call Relevance.

Our definition of designer there means that I don't just make pretty things and then hand them off to developers to do, I do a lot of front end code; I dig as deep into back end as I can which isn't always but I work with developers when I need to. We are very much embedded into the process and we try to keep in not exactly locked step, but definitely in tandem so that we kinda keep that consistent throughout the whole process so, you know, in summary, when I say designer, I mean I don't make things pretty, I don't make things static, I don't make things without code, I make things. And that's all I like to think about when I say designer I make things like that,

But, you know, everyone say the word designer, or they hear me say designer, and they think different things and usually they ask me about these things. We have a problem with the definition of designer in this industry. Everyone has their own ways of using it. I hear you say it and it is kinda like, well that’s not what I do, or its not who I am, or designers do the same thing so, you know I think it is rely worth talking about, What we mean when we talk about designer. We have a communication problem with this. We don’t have our language down right, and so you know that creates problems when we are working. We don’t know who does what. Who can do what role? Who can help out is this area? Who can do this? How do we work together? How do we talk about this stuff? If we don’t even know, have the common phrase about what designer means, have a common definition about what designer means and have a common idea of what a designer is uspposed to be doing in the software industry to help make better stuff then I think we have a problem.

So how any developers feel that they know exactly what a designer is or what a designer does? You can be nasty about it, its ok. Nobody even has any idea? Ok, go for it. (inaudible) Ok, That I feel is a pretty common one. How many people would agree with that? That sounds pretty solid to me, ok.

You're wrong, actually. But you know, thank you for saying that cuz it kinda proves my point, that’s how people think about things. I want to improve our communication on this, and I want you to understand what design is and what it does and how you can interface with it, and how we can all use it and it’s all beautiful and lovely. And the thing I want to start out by saying is that when I say you don't quite understand this, I'm not blaming you, I don't think it is your fault at all. I think we do, we as designers, and I think creative people in general, do a really bad job of explaining what they do and why.

I have an example of this. How many of you guys watch 'Mad Men'? You all should it's awesome. This is Don Draper. If you don't watch 'Mad Men' this first slide is kinda a joke that you may not get, but I'll specify that. (changes slide) So, 'Mad Men' is a TV show and Don Draper is the main character. He is a mid-century creative director at an advertising firm and he is a rock star. Rock star, ninja, all of that stuff put together. The thing is though, he has this great reputation as a creative person, a creative genius actually, he wins awards, everyone sees him as this magical figure. The thing is he doesn't understand what he does. He cannot articulate it to people, people come in to the office and they want to know, you know, how your creative process works and he yells at them. He thinks that that is beneath him to have to explain things. He likes to keep that aura of mystery around him, because that is part of the reason, or what he uses to defend his territory.

And that is also how, if he doesn't have to explain things, no one else can tell him he's doing it wrong or nobody else can come along and do it better.

You probably know developers like that too, but there's a tradition of creative people acting like this and acting like all of our inspiration just comes down from on high and we can't explain it, it's just magic. Right? Have you worked with designers like that? I don't know, "it just feels right". We don't explain it, we don't make a process that's transparent, so it's no wonder that the people we work with, the developers don't really understand how we are working through these things, how we come to these conclusions, how do we choose to use the solutions that we use.

So don't be like Don Draper in many areas, especially in the creative area. We can communicate better and we can all talk about what we're doing to be transparent about that and work on making sure that it's not mystical. Design is not magic. We like to create these boxes, with design over here, and developers over here, and you think with your left brain and they think with their right brain and you know that's just the way people are. That's not how people are. And you have all kinds of capabilities to understand design and you can understand the principles that make it work and you can even employ these principles, whether in their own projects, that you do on your own, or employ them to work better with your designers. #

So I've taken three of my favourite design myths and we're going to go through and bust each one individually

Design Myth #1
--------------
*Design is decoration*

So my first one is the idea that design is decoration. So I've confessed, it is your turn to confess again, how many of you have created a view or whole application and then turned it over designer and said 'make it look pretty'.

 Be honest. There were a lot of you.

Don't do that. Design is not just making something pretty. I know it is tempting, this is my favourite design quote, this is what helped me understand why I wanted to do design in this area :
>"It is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works" _Steve Jobs_

This is just as true for visual design as it is for architecture or any other type of design you have out there. Visual design works with this exact same principal.
It's not just what is pretty. Every choice that you make has something to do back to the functionality.
The colors, the fonts, all that stuff that may just be pretty, they have purposes and they have reasons when we choose them. There's also another quote about this:
>"form follows function" _Louis Sullivan_

And again, this is not just architecture. This is every little pretty thing that we chose have these principles.  We're talking about, what are the other things we choose? Which fonts, we choose colors, what content to use in there, the whole user experience, the hierarchy we make for information,  all these are specific things that have the design decisions behind them.

And how we do that? We work with things like color theory; we work with wire frames; we look at UI patterns, user testing, copy, all these things. This is just a small sample. My point here is to say this is something that is integral in our application, our functionality in the beginning that will come through and your top layer of your prettiness, it has to have that follow though; it has to have that connection, so when you are acting as if it’s a layer that goes on top of things, it may not connect to your base, your foundation, the functionality that you put in there, now you got things out of sync you got one layer here and one layer over here and you don't have a full follow through.

If we can get everybody on the same page and we can also treat that layer of design with the same standard, we understand the pieces that go into it, we understand the things that we used to get there, just like we understand the development process,  and it works the same way, so this is a way to look at design as not being something pretty, not something that just gets slapped on top, this is something that is integrated into the whole process and all the things we used to get there are are just as supported and important as the development things.

Design Myth #2
--------------
*Design is subjective*

The second myth which kind of leads right after that, is that design is subjective and I understand where this one’s come from too. And honestly, like many of these things, I've done a lot of this stuff wrong that many of them, I will probably still continue to do some of the stuff wrong, occasionally.  I know that one of the first times I gave this talk, and I gave this whole thing about design is not subjective we have reasons for why we choose all of these things, and you know, I think about this, is a problem solving process
I have this quote I use in there too:
>"Visual design is about problem solving, not about personal or unsupported opinion." _Bob Baxley_

It's not just about what you feel is right. There are reasons behind this. So I gave this talk and I had somebody ask the question right after that, 'Well, how do you choose fonts?'

And I'm like ‘I choose fonts by like what I feel’. And I'm like 'oh you've got me', like I do that, designer's do that a lot and I've done it before too. The thing is, it's not just what I feel. A lot of times when designers are saying 'I chose a color cuz it feels right', if they're good enough, what they really mean is I have worked with color is long enough, I have worked with applications long enough, and putting the two together and understanding what colors or what fonts get certain results. And what message, which is the same as we want in this particular situation in this particular application, that I know this color is the right one to do.

That's what they mean when they say 'it feels right to me', it means they have going through a lot of that process and they have learned how to use that problem solving process to fit these things in there.
It's not just what they feel about its not just plucking something arbitrarily out of thin air, its the accumulation of a long time of just working with these things the same way if you're working on this other thing and you run into a similar problem that you run into five times before, you know approximately what to apply to fix that.

It is exactly what we do in design and if something seems to come from nowhere, it doesn’t really come from nowhere. Somebody didn't just open a book and pick out that color, pick out that font. It means that they have going through a long enough process to understand what are those elements that work best in these types of situations. It's all about deciding what solves the problem better. These are some of the things we would do to solve design problems. These are very basic design theory and this is hardly any of them, this is just a sample:

Repetition, Emphasis, Balance, Proximity, Ratios, Contrast. All this stuff. This is all very basic design theory. These are principles. These are not just somebody's opinion somebody decided that we're going to do something like this.

These are all guidelines that designers use to achieve a certain effect. I hesitate to say it is a scientific process but it's also not the same thing that we think of we like to think of artists who make s*** up. that’s not the way it works. We have guidelines we have rules, if you will, that produce certain effects.

I like this example and I put this up specifically because when I ask developers what p*sses them of most about designers, the answer that I get the most often is "why do they need so much white space? I don't get it. Why do they need so much white space in there?"

I'm going to tell you why because it's not just white, its negative space - and when a designer is using negative space they're using it to emphasize other areas of the application interface, the page, whatever you happen to be working on, so there's a very particular reason they have that space in there.

It is to draw attention to the elements that need to be drawn attention to; to determine the flow and the way you go around it.

It's not just cuz it looks prettier. It's really not. Well, I mean sometimes it might look prettier, that's also because it solving a problem and that's what it really comes down to is we used these principles to solve certain problems not just because it looks pretty.

Design myth #3
--------------
*Design is separate from development*

So the third myth I want to take on, is this idea, and this kinda summarises a lot of things I've talk about, we have this idea that design is over here and development is over here.

How many people have worked in an environment that are set up like that? I have. I've worked in environments as a designer and I've worked in environments where I have been a front-end developer and had to deal with someone else’s cr*ppy design and they both suck.

And there is nothing I like about any of the systems whatsoever.

I think we just need to completely bust this. This is a little bit of a harsh quote, It is kinda long, so I'm not gonna read it. You guys can read it:
>"Developers, instead of planning and executing with their users in mind, end up creating technological solutions over which they ultimately have little control. Like mad scientists, they fail because they have not imbued their creations with humanity." _Alan Cooper_

Sometimes I do feel that developers can get so much into the planning and the details and there's a lot of them, and I understand that totally, why you do that, but in the end people are using the things that you make, hopefully, ideally, I hope you want people to use the thing you make, cuz that's why I like to make stuff

It is really cool to think about that. And you want some humanity into that. You want to be able to be happy about this. And this kinda distils down into three things. These 3 things are saying you can use all these things for:
You can use a lot of these things just to make your own creations better-designed. These are things that you can learn how to use and learn how to employ and you can make your applications more friendlier.

If you're working on a project on your only you don't have access to a designer don't feel that it has to look like cr*p, just because you don't have another designer person. You can learn all the stuff. I have no formal design background. The only formal education I have is in computer science. And if I can do it, you can totally do it. You can learn how to use these things to learn how to make your own things that you work on, just more personable, more likely for people to want to use them and maybe even a little prettier as they are solving a problem.

The other thing you can do is, you can also use all these ideas to work better with the designers that you work with. How many people work with full-time designers on a regular basis? Not enough as there should be. You should work on that.

But you know it goes back to a lot of the things I'm talking about. There are communication issues. If you understand some of these principles, its the same way for me. I don't know everything about development. I work really hard and as much as I can because that helps me communicate with developers when I am working on a project. When I can understand what they're talking about, what their concerns are, what language it is they're using (and I don't mean specific language) but the language they are using to talk about how they build things.
If I can pick up dev things to communicate better it is completely possible for developers to learn some of these design principles, the design language terms and use that to communicate back and forth and make sure that what we're building in the end is all working back together.

The other thing about this though, is that I would also like you to understand all these design things so that you can go out and hire good designers.

We were talking, we don't have a cohesive definition of design. Some people have ideas that as a designer she does this or do that. The thing is, in this particular niche, in this field, designers can't just make pretty things and I want you to understands what design really is. I dunno I've seen too many shops or just individual people go out like 'I hired a designer, they have a really pretty portfolio of fire, see' and then they don't know how to do HTML, they don't know how to do CSS, they don't know how to design interactions.

That is essential to making good software and to making good things that people use. Making something static, something pretty, is just not good enough and we need to hold our designers to a higher standard and hire people who if they don't already do that, are really willing to jump in and learn how to do that because otherwise then we're not making things that are static, we are not making things that fit on piece of paper, we are making things that work and you need designers who understand how to make things work. I have a term for this. I like to call them digital native designers. That's what I consider myself. I have no formal design training so I started doing web design by teaching myself HTML and then learnt design theory on top of that but because I had started from a technical standpoint everything I learnt about design I applied to that and so that is why I call myself a digital native designer.

But we need designers who understand this functionality and how it works and are able to implement it. You don't have to be a complete wiz on the front end but I think that *** was talking earlier today about they bring people up. They know how to write HTML and CSS. They know how to work other editors that developers work in. They know how to make these tools work, they know how to do all this stuff. This is essential for designers working this industry. As developers, you should understand design enough to hold designers to that standard.

So that's pretty much all I want to go through. I like to leave lots of time for questions cuz every time I do this talk, I have lots and lots of discussion and I like talking about it. So I'll really briefly wrap all that up saying that the slides are available on there <http://speakerdeck.com/jenmyers/developers-cant-understand-design/> and I'm willing to talk about this and throw your questions at me please.
