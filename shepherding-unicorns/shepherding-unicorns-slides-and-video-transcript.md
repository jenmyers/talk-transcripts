So I want to talk to you today about mentoring and mentorship. And I started thinking about this topic because for a while now, I’ve had a lot of people ask me, people who weren’t in the tech industry, or don’t work or do things on the web, would ask me how I got into doing what I do, presumably so they could learn how to do it.Which is great. The only problem with this is that I don’t really know how I got here at all. My path to becoming a web designer and developer has been extremely strange and scattered, and there’s not a whole lot that I can tell people, “Yes, I started here and then I did this and I did that and I ended up here. And if you do that then it’s going to be good too.”I just, I can’t do that. So it started making me think about why can’t I do that and how do I tell other people to find their ways in here because I like what I do and I’d like to bring more people into doing that.So I started thinking a little bit more about education in general. I have a computer science background, but it was kinda weird. And then I’ve always been very naturally good at design things, so I self taught myself a lot of web design and I just took whatever job I could get, and kinda just cobbled together this career.That’s not a really good thing to be able to tell other people. So I got really interested in this idea of how can we bring people in in a smoother way?As they mentioned, I’ve been working with [Girl Develop It](http://www.girldevelopit.com/) for a few years, thinking about education in terms of bringing more people into the industry from a diversity standpoint. I’ve also for the last year and a half worked at [Dev Bootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com/), which is one of the coding schools that is trying to reimagine how we're educating people about this. And it's also made me realize, though, that we can't rely entirely just on these different programs or classes other people are doing to do all the work. There's a lot of things we need to do ourselves, just individually, to step up and be better mentors for the community and also help each other grow throughout our careers.

**[Slide 2: the state of web education]**To kind of talk about how we want to do this, I want to start where we are now in education, and I'm going to ask your for that. So can everybody here who has a college degree in exactly the work they do now raise their hands?
[Laughter] Even better, thanks.
Alright, how about, how many people here are entirely self taught in terms of the job they do now?
Ok, alright. Some of you didn't raise your hands at all. I thought those were two sides of the same coin. But, so somebody... Who has found a completely different way here?Alright, I'm not completely sure what those are but good for you.
How many people feel that sometimes it's challenging to keep learning in this field with the pace of new information?
Alright, cool. So thank you for giving me the answers that I was hoping for. So I don't have to, like, change my premise. That was really cool of you. But no, fortunately, this is, these are the type of things...
There's a lot of... there are some people who had some college degrees, some people who find it laughable, that's cool too. A lot of people who are self-taught. A lot of people who had, similar to my own experiences, different paths of coming here. And also, I think a lot of you, almost all of you were concerned  or worried about being able to keep up with new information.
So we kind of have this jumbled educational pathway here. And then, like I said, that pretty much mirrors what I've known in my own experience also what I've seen in my friends and colleagues. So I think it's fair to extrapolate that this is kind of the state of web education now: really, really fractured. Like I said before, that makes it really difficult to figure out how we're bringing people in and how we're growing people.
Also at the same time, we want to think about not necessarily just bringing people in, but how to get people to focus on a certain thing or not. As I mentioned before, I kinda have done some design and development and I've always been one of these in between people. That's how I've managed to get by.
But it's also really hard for us to teach people who have a really good holistic understanding of everything we're working with, maybe a whole product that we're making, or the web as a whole, or a whole user base, or many of these things that require a lot of understanding of many different moving pieces. I think we're also not searching for way to find people who have that full understanding of what's going on. Hopefully, you are with me, and you're like, "Yes, we need to fix this." If you're not though, there's a really important reason. At least, it's important to me; I'll make the case of why we need to bring more people in and educate them properly and make sure they understand the whole of what's going on.
**[Slide 3: graph with a single straight line increasing rapidly from "now" to "future"]**
This is a graph that is intending to depict internet use now, and web product use now, and where it's going in the future. It's very scientific cause I just made it up. But I'm not an expert, but I feel confident enough to say that the internet's not going to go anywhere, and we are probably not going to be using products on the web less than we are now. So the idea of making sure that what we're doing, what we're making, is equal to this demand and we have enough people to come in and actually make it. I don't think this is a need or a problem that's going to go away any time soon.
There's also a sense of the more people who are using things on the web, we wanna make sure, I wanna make sure, that the amount of people using it is also being reflected in who's being created. It's kind of this gap between consumers and creators.
I have and 8 year old daughter. And so, she loves the internet and stuff on websites, and things like that. But there isn't always a lot of that understand of what it takes to make that. And that worries me a little bit; I don't want to push her into any particular field, but I want her to have this education and understanding of what's involved in all of it, and what the relevance is, what the impact of it is. So as we move forward into the future, the need for having people who are very informed creators of the products that we're all going to be using on a regular basis means that we really need to make sure that we've got solid education bringing them in there and carrying them through.
**[Slide 4: unicorns]**
So I also want to talk quickly about the idea of unicorns, cause that was in my topic. Some of you may be here because you like unicorns; I mean this extremely metaphorically, sorry to disappoint. But unicorns is a word that gets thrown around a little bit in this industry. Everybody seems to have a slightly different meaning. I use it because it tends to refer to somebody who has skill sets that they're not supposed to have, that are even maybe opposed to each other.
A lot of times its a designer-dev. So you're, oh, you can't be both of those. But I think a lot of times it's anybody who seems to have anything that's beyond one narrow definition of what they can do or understand. As I said before, I think that this is something that we can stop saying unicorns are special people that just happen and that unicorns are people that we can foster and encourage and actually make, and that everybody actually has the potential and the capability to be a unicorn, to be somebody who can learn different skill sets, incorporate them in what they're already good at and have a wider, broader, more holistic understanding of what they're working with.
So not only do we want to educate people in our own narrow pathways, of how to get where what we're doing, but I think we also wanna think very carefully about how we're educating people to encompass a lot more than that and maybe do things that we don't think are typically within the same realm of skills. But pushing people to learn those things, even to a certain degree, and understanding the whole of what we're working on. And I do feel very strongly that we all have the potential to do that, to be unicorns if you will.

**[Slide 5: be the mentor you wish to see in the world]**Before we can get more people to learn all those things though, and become these things, we need to teach them. And as I've been talking so far, we have a little bit of a dearth of programs, university programs, non-university programs, all of this stuff, all the way back through school that is really gonna teach people how to do this. We can't really wait for them to catch up. This is moving really quickly, and slowly universities are catching up, slowly high schools are catching up, elementary schools, all of that. But we don't really have the time to wait for them to catch up, because it's already going too fast.
So our solution, really, is that we all need to do this in kind of a grassroots individual way. We're gonna work on education, and we're gonna work on making people into unicorns and we can't rely on anybody outside of us to necessarily do that for us. So we're gonna figure out how to it ourselves.
And the thing is, just like everybody has the potential to be a mentor... I ruined that, spoiled it, totally. Just as everybody has the potential to be a unicorn, everybody also has the potential to be a mentor, to a unicorn even.
So what we're gonna go through now is some of the tips and tricks that I've picked up in terms of how to teach people. Even if you think that you have nothing to share with somebody, or that you can teach it effectively, it's a learned skill, and you can completely learn these things. And a lot of times the things that we need to teach people in order for them to learn more are not necessarily the nuts and bolts of certain technologies or what you do from day to day, but it's a little bit more how we understand and teach things. So let's do that.
**[Slide 6: what do we teach?]**
If we want to start teaching, what is it exactly that we teach?

**[Slide 7: learning how to learn]**One of the most important things that you can teach somebody is how to learn themselves, to kind of learn the skill of learning. And that sounds very meta. But it is a skill.
A lot of people in here said they were self-taught, right? Did anybody teach you, told you that or was it just a long painful process of banging your head against walls and figuring things out? To a certain extent, there's gonna be some of that in there.
But we also have a sense of education. A lot of us were probably, if not all of us, were brought up in a sense of education where we go into a room and we sit down and something gives us things, and then we regurgitate it back, and we get a mark, good or bad, and that's education. We memorize some things, and we've proved we memorize some things, and we get to pass on to the next level of memorizing things, and we're educated. In some certain senses, that's a good thing, but how much are we really learning when everything is being spoon-fed to us? How much are we really getting out for ourselves?
So this idea of unlearning those expectations and learning what we can do to dig out information for ourselves. And more importantly than that, the way to dig out information you need is learning how to ask the right questions and formulate an understanding of what the problem at hand truly is so that you can fgure out how to go find the information about it.
And honestly, learning how to ask the right questions is a lot more difficult than finding the answers to those questions. It's about problem solving. It's about information gathering. It's the same type of thing that most of us do on a daily basis when we have a problem to solve at hand. Learning anything is no different from this, and you can through a practice, and working with other people build up these skills of how you're conceptualizing a problem and how you're figuring out how to target the information that you need to go out and find.
So this idea of learning how to learn is actually one of the most important things that we can mentor other people in and giving them a space to unlearn the old ways of learning and not being expected to be handed everything, cause they're not really going to get as much out of that in the end. If we can teach them how to learn, then they can continue to learn
